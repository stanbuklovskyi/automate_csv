# ðŸ’» Process multiple data files automatically using Python
A simple procedure that can save hours of data processing and file handling. The code will be useful if you need to process multiple .csv files at once and gives you a quick understanding of repetitive tasks automation in Python. (example data included)

âœ” Find all necessary files 

âœ” Rename consistently and move to a subfolder for processing 

âœ” Simple processing and export as one .csv file

This is far from perfect but it's a great and practical introduction to automation of repetative tasks in Python. Enjoy!
